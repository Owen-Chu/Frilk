# Origin
This was a drinks company that was formed in Year 8 for an ICT project. This was a joint adventure with me and a friend.

# Placement
[Frilk](https://sites.google.com/view/frilk/Home) placed 7th out of 14 companies having raised Â£1216 in investment from fellow companies.

# Rivalry
Formed an admittedly one sided rivalry with [Alcoholish](https://sites.google.com/view/alcoholish/home?authuser=0) who came 2nd in the competition, constantly innovating and attempting to one up eachother's brands.
